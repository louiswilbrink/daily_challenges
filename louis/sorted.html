The Luhn algorithm will detect almost any single-digit error, almost all transpositions of adjacent digits except 09 and 90, and many other errors.<br><br>The Luhn algorithm works from right-to-left, with the right-most digit being the check digit.

The number is valid if the sum is divisible by ten.<br><br>For example, the number 49927398716 is valid according to the Luhn algorithm. Starting from the right, the sum is 6 + (2) + 7 + (1 + 6) + 9 + (6) + 7 + (4) + 9 + (1 + 8) + 4 = 70, which is divisible by 10; the digit-sums of the doubled digits have been shown in parentheses.<br><br><br>Your task is to write two functions, one that adds a check digit to a identifying number and one that tests if an identifying number is valid.<br><br><br><br>source: programmingpraxis.com<br><br><br><br><br>

And you can represent very large numbers very easily, if you want to write down a million, you just write "1000000". That's only seven digits!<br><br>It wasn't so easy for the Romans. They had to make due with their clumsy Roman numerals. Think how hard it is to add Roman numerals together. If you wanted to add XXVIII with LXXXII, you would have to smush them together to form LXXXXXVIIIII, then you would have to realize that XXXXX is equal to L and IIIII is equal to V, and turn it to LLVV, and then you'd have to shorten that to CX. Look how much work to just add 28 and 82! And just imagine trying to write a million with Roman numerals: you'd literally have to write down one thousand copies of M!<br><br>But Roman numerals aren't without advantages: they at least look very pretty. I think we can all agree that Rocky V looks way cooler than Rocky 5. <br><br>So in this challenge, we honor the romans. Your task is to write a function that can add together two Roman numerals supplied as strings. Example: roman_addition("XXVIII", "LXXXII") returns "CX". <br><br>The easiest way to do this would obviously be to just to convert the roman numerals to integers and then convert the sum of those integers back to a Roman numeral. But since the Romans couldn't do that, you can't either! Write the function so that it performs the task similarly to how it might have been done in ancient Rome, either with the "smushing together" method I described above, or another method of your choosing (don't worry about efficiency). But at no point shall you convert the numerals to decimal or binary integers! Imagine if you lived in ancient Rome and decimal numbers hadn't been invented yet, how would you do it? <br><br>The output of this function should as "minimal" as possible. I.e. if the answer is XVII, it should output XVII, not XIIIIIII or VVVII.<br><br>Real Roman numerals sometimes uses a trick to make the numbers shorter: you put a smaller numeral in front of a larger numeral to represent the difference between the two. So for instance, 4 would be written as "IV", 9 as "IX" or 1949 as "MCMIL". For the purposes of this problem, lets ignore that. 4 is "IIII", 9 is "VIIII" and 1949 is "MDCCCCXXXXVIIII". The numbers become longer this way, but it makes much more sense if all the numerals are "in order". Also, the exact rules for how this trick worked was never rigorous, and changed over time.<br><br>For reference, here's the different single numerals and their value:<br><br>    I = 1    <br>    V = 5    = IIIII    <br>    X = 10   = VV           <br>    L = 50   = XXXXX        <br>    C = 100  = LL           <br>    D = 500  = CCCCC         <br>    M = 1000 = DD            <br><br>**Bonus 1**: Write a function that does subtraction. Example: roman_subtraction("CX", "LXXXII") returns "XXVIII"<br><br>**Bonus 2**: Write a function that performs multiplication with Roman numerals, again without ever converting them to regular integers. Example: roman_multiplication("XVI", "VII") returns "CXII". <br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://redd.it/socdy">[4/23/2012] Challenge #42 [difficult]</a><br>A *simple graph* is a graph that allows only one edge between two vertices and no edges that start end end in the same vertex (usually called "loops"). If a simple graph has V vertices, the maximum number of edges in that graph is V\*(V-1)/2, which happens when every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. This is called a *complete graph*.<br><br>A graph is said to be *connected* if you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by travelling on the edges. The minimum number of edges required for a graph of V vertices to be connected is V - 1 (a graph with the minimum number of vertices needed to be connected is called a *tree*). <br><br>To demonstrate the concept of connectedness, let's say that you have a simple graph of six vertices named 0,1,2,3,4 and 5, which has the following edges: (0,1), (2,3), (3,4) and (4,2). This graph is not connected, because there is no way to (for instance) get from vertex 1 to vertex 2, or from vertex 3 to vertex 5. In fact, if you drew the graph on a piece of paper, you'd see that it forms three "islands", with 0 and 1 on one island connected by the edge (0,1); 2,3 and 4 on one island connected in a triangle; and 5 on island of its own, connected to no other vertex.<br><br>Let's say that you had a simple graph with 50 vertices named 0,1,2,3,....,48,49 and the following 45 edges:<br><br>    ( 0,22),( 0,39),( 0,47),( 1, 5),( 2,38),( 2,39),( 2,44),( 4,23),( 4,33)    <br>    ( 5,19),( 6,17),( 6,35),( 6,45),( 7,49),( 8,24),( 8,40),( 9,25),( 7,10)    <br>    (10,11),(10,21),(11,30),(12,32),(13,27),(14,33),(14,36),(15,49),(16,48)    <br>    (18,37),(18,45),(19,24),(19,40),(20,39),(21,34),(25,36),(26,27),(26,31)    <br>    (26,32),(28,48),(29,36),(29,41),(35,43),(38,42),(39,44),(43,46),(48,49)    <br><br>This graph is obviously not connected, because there aren't enough edges to meet the minimum requirement (you would need at least 49). Write a program that prints how many islands of vertices there are, and what vertices there are on each island. In other words, print out some number of sets of vertices where in each individual set all vertices are connected to each other, but no two vertices in different sets are.<br><br>**Bonus**: For a graph of 1000000 (one million) vertices, the number of possible edges is 100000\*999999/2 = 499999500000 (almost five hundred billion), but obviously not all edges are needed for the graph to be fully connected. Create a graph of 1000000 vertices and no edges, and then one by one start adding edges to it, randomly selected from all possible edges, until you have a connected graph. How many edges did you add before the graph became connected? (note: this number will obviously be different every time you run the program)<br><br><br>

<a href="http://redd.it/sv6q6">[4/27/2012] Challenge #45 [intermediate]</a><br>When linguists study ancient and long dead languages, they sometimes come upon a situation where a certain word only appears once in all of the collected texts of that language. Words like that are obviously very bothersome, since they are exceedingly hard to translate (there's almost no context to what the word might mean).<br><br>Such a word is refered to as a *[hapax legomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon)* (which is Greek for roughly "word once said"). The proper plural is *hapax legomena*, but they are frequently refered to as just "hapaxes". <br><br>However, a hapax legomenon doesn't just need to be a word that appears only once in an entire language; they can also be words that appears only once in a single work, or the body of work of an author. Lets take Shakespeare as an example. In all the works of Shakespeare, the word "correspondance" occurs only in one place, the beginning of Sonnet 148:<br><br>&gt;*O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,*    <br>&gt;*Which have no correspondence with true sight,*    <br>&gt;*Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,*    <br>&gt;*That censures falsely what they see aright?*    <br><br>Now, "correspondance" is 14 letters long, which is a pretty long word. It is, however, not the longest hapax legomenon in Shakespeare. The longest by far is *[honorificabilitudinitatibus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorificabilitudinitatibus)* from *Love's Labour's Lost* (drink a couple of shots of whiskey and try and pronounce that word, I dare you!)<br><br>[Here is a link](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt) to a text-file containing the Complete Works of William Shakespeare (it's 5.4 mb big), provided by the good people of Project Gutenberg. Write a program that analyses that file and finds all words that <br><br>1. Only occur once in the entire text<br>2. Are longer than "correspondance", i.e. words that are 15 letters long or longer. <br><br>***<br>Bonus: If you do the first part of this problem, you will likely come up with a list of words that cannot be said to be "true" hapax legomenon. For instance, you might have found the word "distemperatures" which appears only once in *The Comedy of Errors*. But that is simply the plural of *distemperature*, and *distemperature* appears in *A Midsummer's Night Dream*, so "distemperatures" cannot be said to be a "true" hapax. Same thing with the word *superstitiously*: it also occurs only once but *superstitious* occurs many times. Even the example I used above can be said to not be a true hapax, because while *correspondance* only appears once, variations of *correspond* appears a number of times. <br><br>Modify your program to identify and make it detect when a word appears twice or more in a simple variation, like a plural or adverbial form (hint: words ending in "s", "ly", "ing" and "ment"), so that it can sort it out. Then, find the *true* number of hapax legomena in Shakespeare that are longer than 14 characters. By my count (which may very well be wrong), there are less than 20 of them. <br><br><br><br>

<a href="http://redd.it/t33vi">[5/2/2012] Challenge #47 [easy]</a><br>Your task today is to implement one of the oldest ciphers known, the so-called [Caesar cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) (or *Caesar shift*, as it is sometimes called). It works like this: for every letter you want to encrypt, you shift it some number of places down the alphabet to get the letter in the cipher. <br><br>So, for instance, in a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, "A" becomes "D", "B" becomes "E", "C" becomes "F", and so on. At the end of the alphabet it wraps around, so "W" becomes "Z", "X" becomes "A", "Y" becomes "B" and "Z" becomes "C". If you encrypt "Hello" with a shift of 3, you get "Khoor".<br><br>One interesting thing about this cipher is that you can use the same algorithm to decode a cipher as you can to encode it: if you wish to decrypt some text that has been Caesar-shifted 6 places, you simply shift it another 20 places to get back the original text. For example, if you encrypt "Daily programmer"  with a shift of 6 you get "Jgore vxumxgsskx", and if you encrypt "Jgore vxumxgsskx" with a shift of 20 you get "Daily programmer".<br><br>Implement the cipher and encrypt a bit of text of your choice!<br><br><br>***<br>Bonus: Using your program, become a code-cracker and decrypt this cipher (posted in honor of Mayday):<br><br>    Spzalu - zayhunl dvtlu sfpun pu wvukz kpzaypibapun zdvykz pz uv ihzpz mvy h <br>    zfzalt vm nvclyutlua.

You pick a door, say No. 1 [but the door is not opened], and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.

<a href="http://redd.it/tb2h7">[5/7/2012] Challenge #49 [difficult]</a><br>When you roll two regular six-sided dice, the total number of pips that can come up ranges from 2 (if both dice show 1) to 12 (if both dice show 6), but as all experienced gamblers know, some numbers are more likely than others. In fact, the most likely number to come up is 7, with a probability of 1/6. By contrast, the probability of 12 showing is only 1/36, so it is six times more likely that the dice will show 7 than it is that they will show 12. <br><br>The reason for this is of course that there are more ways that two dice can sum to 7. In fact, there are exactly six ways two dice can sum to 7: the first die can show 1 and the second 6, the first 2 and the second 5, the first 3 and the second 4, the first 4 and the second 3, the first 5 and the second 2, and finally the first die can show 6 and the second 1. Given that there are a total of 6*6 = 36 different ways the dice can land, this gives us the probability: 6/36 = 1/6. In contrast, there is only one way two dice can form 12, by throwing two sixes. <br><br>Define a function f(d, n) that gives the number of ways d six-sided dice can be thrown to show the number n. So, in the previous example, f(2,7) = 6. Here are a few other values of that function:<br><br>f(1,n) = 1 (for 1&amp;le;n&amp;le;6, 0 otherwise)    <br>f(2,7) = 6        <br>f(2,10) = 3    <br>f(2,12) = 1    <br>f(3,10) = 27    <br>f(5,20) = 651    <br>f(7,30) = 12117    <br>f(10,50) = 85228    <br><br>Find f(20, 100)<br><br>Note: the answer fits into a 64-bit integer<br>***<br><br>Bonus: Find f(1100, 5000) mod 10^7<br><br><br>

Here are some examples of A(p(n), v):<br><br>    A(p(5), 100) = {7, 11}                        <br>    A(p(7), 1000) = {5, 11, 17}                   <br>    A(p(8), 2000) = {3, 5, 7, 19}                 <br>    A(p(10), 10000000) = {2, 5, 7, 11, 19, 23, 29}<br><br>Find A(p(20), 10^18 )<br><br>***<br><br>BONUS: Find A(p(40), 10^60 )<br><br>***<br><br>NOTES: If it is more convienient, you are allowed to make your A(s,v) function output the product instead of the subset itself, so A(p(5), 100) = 77 instead of {7,11}.

<a href="http://redd.it/tux8f">[5/19/2012] Challenge #54 [easy]</a><br>A transposition cipher we'll call the "matrix cipher" can be defined as follows: write each character in the text that you want to encrypt in a matrix of some specified width, where the width is the key of the cipher. So, for instance, if you wanted to encrypt "The cake is a lie!" with the key 3, you would write it like so (the spaces are replaced with underscores for clarity):<br><br>    T h e<br>    _ c a<br>    k e _<br>    i s _<br>    a _ l<br>    i e !<br>    <br>Then to get the ciphertext, you simply read off the columns one by one. So in this case, the ciphertext would be "T\_kiaihces\_eea\_\_l!", or "T kiaihces eea&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;l!" if you put the spaces back in. <br><br>If the text doesn't fit the matrix perfectly, you add in random letters to fill in the last row. So, if we wanted to encode "The cake is a lie!" with key 7, we'd construct this matrix:<br><br>    T h e _ c a k<br>    e _ i s _ a _<br>    l i e ! v m z<br>    <br>Here "v", "m" and "z" have been added in to fill the last row, and the ciphertext is "Telh ieie s!c vaamk z".<br><br>Write an implementation of the matrix cipher that can both encode and decode text given the correct key.<br><br>***<br><br>BONUS: One of the major tricks code-crackers have used throughout history is the fact that the first parts of many messages often follow a regular pattern. They start with "Hello" or "Greetings", "Transmission from" or something like that (Allied codebreakers during World War II took advantage of the fact that Nazi messages often began with "Heil Hitler").<br><br>Use this trick to construct a way to automatically crack messages encrypted with the matrix cipher. That is, given a certain ciphertext to crack and the first few characters of the cleartext, figure out what the entire message is without human input. Your code should just return the correct answer and optionally the key, but nothing else.<br><br>Try your code-cracker on this text, using the clue that the message starts with "It seems" (or "It_seems", if you use the underscore):<br><br>    I_rso_wotTe,taef_h__hl__socaeihtemonraaheamd_svemsp_l_ems_ayiN___Anofeadt.yueo_o<br>    h_..__leaA_.iaastnY.snw__do__d_nyeuhl_foor_eiaotushlvrr.'oapee.avnv_d__he,ey_gOf<br>    ___oiunrbpaunieeer_r_l_geos_ctoingoloyfq_rcam__ilainpotlimadufhjv_llt_emiw_aevsd<br>    nrsdriengieysr_p_tc_,tlfteuc_uitwrrawavzo_irhlez_ftrelszloyyry_bir__e_huv_no_ead<br>    eauuyvsbs_mtoe_l.rb_urat_eeh_y_pOsreg_fjnp,rocucee___otn_cpgbmujltaayprgiayr_uep<br>    fb_btt,velyahe_s,eogeraq__ue__ncysr.hcdzoo__ar_duftTcioi'tahkmnarwxeeeegeae_r__j<br><br>As you can see, there's plenty of punctuation in this text, but there are no new-lines, it is just one chunk of text.

But regular expressions can also be over-relied on and abused, and make code unreadable. There is a lot of truth in the old saying "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems." So today, lets embrace those two problems and pound some regular expressions into submission!<br><br>Your task is to write a regular expression that will match a string if and only if the number of vowels (both upper and lower case) in that string is exactly divisible by 3. For instance, the regular expression will not match the string "Hello!", because there are only two vowels there, "e" and "o" (and 2 is not divisible by 3), but it will match "Daily programmer" because there are six vowels, "D**ai**l**y** pr**o**gr**a**mm**e**r" (and 6 is divisible by 3). <br><br>For the purposes of this problem, the vowels of the English language are "A", "E", "I", "O", "U" and "Y" (in both upper and lower cases, obviously). <br><br>Here are a few strings you can test your regular expressions on: <br><br>1. "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!"<br>2. "Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."<br>3. "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."<br>4. "To be, or not to be- that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them."<br>5.

<a href="http://redd.it/u8jmi">[5/28/2012] Challenge #58 [easy]</a><br>As computer programmers are well aware, it can be very useful to write numbers using numerical bases other than the familiar base 10 notation we use in everyday life. In computer programming, [base 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) and [base 16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) are especially handy. In base 2, the number 1234 becomes 10011010010 and in base 16 it becomes 4D2. <br><br>Because there are only 10 regular digits, when numbers are written in base 16, the first few letters of the alphabet are added to represent the remaining required digits, so 'A' stands in for 10, 'B' for 11, 'C' for 12, 'D' for 13, 'E' for 14 and 'F' for 15. <br><br>Of course, this trick of adding letters to stand in for numbers allows us to represent higher bases than 16; if you can use all letters of the alphabet, you can represent bases up to base 36 (because there are ten regular digits and 26 "letter-digits"). So for instance, 12345678 becomes 1L2FHE in base 23 and 4IDHAA in base 19. <br><br>Write a program that will take a number and convert it to any base between 2 and 36. Have the program print out 19959694 in base 35 and 376609378180550 in base 29. <br><br>NOTE: Many languages have this built in as a library function. For instance, in Java, the function Integer.toString(i, radix) does exactly this. However, the entire point of this challenge is to write the program yourself, so you **are not** allowed to use any library functions like this.<br><br>***<br><br>BONUS: A number is said to be "palindromic in base N" if, when written in base N the number is the same backwards and forwards. So, for instance, the number 16708 is palindromic in base 27, because in base 27 the number is written as MOM, obviously a palindrome. The number 12321 is a palindrome in in base 10, because 12321 written backwards is 12321. Some numbers are palindromic in several bases, the number 15167 for instance is palindromic in bases 9, 27, 28, 35 and 36. <br><br>In what bases is the number 10858 palindromic?<br><br>* Thanks to [Hannoii](http://www.reddit.com/user/Hannoii) for suggesting this problem and /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!

The totient of n is computed as φ(pq) = (p−1) × (q−1). Then two keys are chosen, the encryption key e and the decryption key d, such that de ≡ 1 (mod φ(pq)) and gcd(e, φ(pq)) = 1. Then, given a message m, an integer on the range 0 &lt; m &lt;n, the message is encrypted by computing m^e (mod n) and the resulting cipher-text c is decrypted by computing c^d (mod n).<br><br><br><br><br>The standard definition of RSA cryptography is known as [PKCS #1](http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125). It provides a method for converting a text message to a number m suitable for encryption, and converting it back to the original text message. It is also possible to use RSA to provide non-forgeable signatures; the basic idea is that the sender encrypts a message hash with his decryption key, so the receiver can decrypt the message hash with the sender’s public key, which works because only the sender knows his private decryption key.<br><br>Your task is to write an RSA key generator and procedures to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm.<br><br>Here is the [RSA wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsa) to help you in understanding. <br><br><br><br>

Lets define the operation of "rotating a number" as taking the last binary digit of that number and moving it so it becomes the first binary digit, and moving the other digits one step forward. I.e. if you rotate 10011, you get 11001 (i.e. 25), because the 1 that was in the last position has now moved to the first position. If you rotate it again, you get 11100 (i.e. 28).<br><br>If you rotate it again, something curious happens: you get 01110, which is the same as 1110 (i.e. 14) since leading zeroes don't count in a binary representation. That is to say, when you rotate it this time, the zero disappears. If you rotate it once more, you get 0111, which is the same as 111 (i.e. 7). Again, the zero has disappeared. <br><br>After that, the number remains the same regardless of how much you rotate it, since the binary number representation of 7 only has 1's in it. <br><br>This gives us a sequence of numbers.

<a href="http://redd.it/uo1a3">[6/6/2012] Challenge #61 [difficult]</a><br>As is well known, the decimal expansion of sqrt(N) when N is not a perfect square, goes on forever and does not repeat. For instance, sqrt(8) starts out 2.82842712... and never starts repeating itself. This is because when N is not a perfect square, [sqrt(N) is irrational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_descent#Irrationality_of_.E2.88.9Ak_if_it_is_not_an_integer) and [all numbers with repeating decimals are rational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Every_repeating_or_terminating_decimal_is_a_rational_number). <br><br>However, if instead of using a decimal representation, you use a [continued fraction representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) of sqrt(N) when N is not a perfect square, then it will always have a repeating period. For instance, [this is the beginning of the continued fraction of sqrt(8)](http://i.imgur.com/WWlFJ.gif). The pattern of 1,4,1,4,1,4,... will repeat forever (the first integer, the 2, is not included in the period). A continued fraction with a period like this can be written as [a; [b,c,d,...]], where a is the first number outside of the fraction, and b, c, d, etc. are the period repeating inside the fraction. For example, sqrt(8) has a continued fraction representation of [2; [1,4]].<br><br>Here are some other continued fraction representations of square roots:<br>    <br>    sqrt(2) = [1; [2]]<br>    sqrt(13) = [3; [1, 1, 1, 1, 6]]<br>    sqrt(19) = [4; [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8]]<br>    sqrt(26) = [5; [10]]<br>    <br>Let Q(N) be the sum of the numbers in the period for the continued fraction representation of sqrt(N).

Martin (the basis for the HBO show Game of Thrones) knows that while the books are generally excellent, there are *a lot* of characters. A staggering number, in fact, and it can be very hard to remember who's who and who is related to who and who had an incestual relationship with what sister or brother.<br><br>So, today, we make that a little bit easier! What follows at the end here is a list of 50+ characters from the books and a list detailing how their related. Each character is given a two-letter code (for instance "AA" or "BQ") and a specification of their gender ("M" or "F"), and then what follows is a list detailing how they're related to the other characters. <br><br>To make things simple, there's only one "basic" relationship, which is "A is parent to B", written as "-&gt;". So, for instance, if Arya Stark has the code "AI" and Eddard Stark has the code "AB", then "AB-&gt;AI" means "Eddard Stark is parent to Arya Stark". Each person may have 0, 1 or 2 parents specified somewhere in the list, but no more.<br><br>(I should point out here that this family tree contains *no spoilers*. This is the family tree as it stands in the beginning of Book 1, though some of the characters you wont meet until much later. For those of you who've read the books or seen the show, please don't put any spoilers in the comments, even in hidden spoiler text.)<br><br>Write a program that parses this list, and can then answer questions about the relationships between people. Here are a list of functions you should write:<br><br>* ancestors(person) which gives the direct ancestors of that person (parents, grand-parents, great-grand-parents, etc.). For instance, ancestors("Asha Greyjoy") should return ["Balon Greyjoy", "Alannys Harlaw", "Quellon Greyjoy"]. What is the result to ancestors("Daenerys Targaryen")?<br><br>* descendants(person) which gives you the direct descendants of that person (children, grand-children, great-grand-children, etc.). What is the result of descendants("Jaehaerys Targaryen")?<br><br>* brothers(person) and sisters(person) which gives the brothers and sisters of the specified person (including half-brothers and half-sisters, though you could write special functions for full siblings and half siblings if you want).<br><br>* aunts(person) and uncles(person) which gives you the aunts and uncles of the specified person.<br><br>* cousins(person), which gives you the 1st cousins of the specified person.<br><br>* Bonus: As a bonus, write a function called relationship(person1, person2) which returns person1's relationshipt to person2 as a string (i.e. "Grandfather", "1st cousin", "Brother", "Great uncle", "Not related" etc.). As with all bonuses on /r/dailyprogrammer, this is entirely optional.

<a href="http://redd.it/v89by">[6/18/2012] Challenge #66 [intermediate]</a><br>Maxiphobic heaps are a variant of leftist heaps. Like leftist heaps, maxiphobic heaps are represented as binary trees arranged according to the heap property that every element is less than or equal to its two children. Find-min looks at the root of the tree, delete-min discards the root and merges its two children, and insert merges the existing tree with a singleton tree containing the new element.<br><br>The key to leftist trees and maxiphobic trees is the merge operation. In leftist trees, the rank of each left child is always less than the rank of its sibling, where the rank of a node is defined as the length of its right spine, and the merge operation enforces this invariant.  <br><br>In maxiphobic trees, the merge operation is implemented by comparing the roots of the two trees. The smaller root survives as the root of the merged tree. That leaves three sub-trees: the tree that lost in the comparison of the two roots, and the child sub-trees of the winner. They are merged by first merging the two smaller trees, where the size of a tree is determined as the number of elements it contains, then attaching that merged tree along with the remaining tree as the children of the new root. <br><br>The name maxiphobic, meaning “biggest avoiding,” refers to the merge of the two smaller sub-trees.<br><br><br>Your task is to write functions that implement maxiphobic trees.<br><br>source : [programmingpraxis.com](http://programmingpraxis.com/2010/09/28/maxiphobic-heaps/)<br><br><br>

<a href="http://redd.it/vbr0z">[6/20/2012] Challenge #67 [easy]</a><br>As we all know, when computers do calculations or store numbers, they don't use decimal notation like we do, they use binary notation. So for instance, when a computer stores the number 13, it doesn't store "1" and "3", it stores "1101", which is 13 in binary.<br><br>But more than that, when we instruct it to store an integer, we usually tell it to store it in a certain datatype with a certain length. For (relatively small) integers, that length is usually as 32 bits, or four bytes (also called "one word" on 32-bit processors). So 13 isn't really stored as "1101", it's stored as "00000000000000000000000000001101".<br><br>If we were to reverse that bit pattern, we would get "10110000000000000000000000000000", which written in decimal becomes "2952790016".<br><br>Write a program that can do this "32-bit reverse" operation, so when given the number 13, it will return 2952790016. <br><br>Note: just to be clear, for all numbers in this problem, we are using *unsigned* 32 bit integers.<br><br>***<br><br>* Thanks to [HazzyPls](http://www.reddit.com/user/HazzyPls) for suggesting this problem at /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!

<a href="http://redd.it/vmbnb">[6/26/2012] Challenge #69 [intermediate]</a><br>During World War I, the German army used a very clever pen and paper cipher called the [ADFGVX cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher), and your task today is to implement functions to both encrypt and decrypt messages using this cipher. What follows is a rather lengthy description of how it works (you can also find a description in that wikipedia link), but in essence it is actually quite simple. <br><br>Here is how it works:<br><br>The cleartext (the message that is to be encrypted) could consist of characters selected from an alphabet of 36 characters. For the purposes of today's problem, that alphabet will be: <br><br>    "ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 "<br>    <br>That is, it will be the regular uppercase alphabet except for the letter J (if there's a J in the cleartext, replace it with an I), ten numbers, and a space character. That makes 25 + 10 + 1 = 36 different characters.<br><br>The ciphertext will consist of only 6 different characters, namely the characters "ADFGVX". Supposedly these were selected because they are quite unlike each other in morse code, lessening the risk for errors in transmission.<br><br>The key for the encryption and decryption consists of two parts: first one scrambled version of the cleartext alphabet (i.e. some permutation of "ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 "), called the *substition key*. Second we need a *transposition key* which is a just a codeword of some sort.<br><br>Lets illustrate the encryption of the cleartext "Brake me out of jail on the 21st." using the substitution key "R3FLMX7KWQ69D4Y5NOZ STV2EH8AP1ICBGU0" and the transposition key "PROGRAMMER"<br><br>Encryption proceeds as follows: we begin by putting the cleartext in A suitable format, so that it only contains characters from the alphabet. Our cleartext then becomes "BRAKE ME OUT OF IAIL ON THE 21ST". As you can see, all characters have been put into uppercase, the "J" have been replaced by an "I", and all characters not in the alphabet (in this example, only the period ".") have been removed.<br><br>Next we put the substitution key into a 6x6 table with the cipher chars "ADFGVX" as row and column headers, like this:<br><br>       A D F G V X<br>      +------------<br>    A | R 3 F L M X<br>    D | 7 K W Q 6 9<br>    F | D 4 Y 5 N O<br>    G | Z   S T V 2 <br>    V | E H 8 A P 1<br>    X | I C B G U 0<br>  <br>Each letter of the cleartext now gets replaced by two letters representing the row and column of the character in this square. So for instance, 'A' becomes 'VG' (because it's in the V row and the G column), 'B' becomes 'XF', 'C' becomes 'XD', etc. This is called "fractioning" the text. If we convert our cleartext using this method it becomes:<br><br>    B  R  A  K  E     M  E     O  U  T     O  F    <br>    XF AA VG DD VA GD AV VA GD FX XV GG GD FX AF GD <br>    <br>    I  A  I  L     O  N     T  H  E     2  1  S  T<br>    XA VG XA AG GD FX FV GD GG VD VA GD GX VX GF GG<br><br>Note that the space character is encoded as GD. <br><br>Next, this fractioned text is put into a table with the transposition key as headers, as follows:<br>    <br>    P R O G R A M M E R<br>    -------------------<br>    X F A A V G D D V A <br>    G D A V V A G D F X <br>    X V G G G D F X A F <br>    G D X A V G X A A G <br>    G D F X F V G D G G <br>    V D V A G D G X V X <br>    G F G G F G F A D F<br>    <br>The last row didn't quite fit (it was six letters short), so we add in some random characters, in this case "FGFADF", to fill it out. Now the columns are sorted in alphabetical order of the header characters:<br>    <br>    A E G M M O P R R R<br>    -------------------<br>    G V A D D A X F V A<br>    A F V G D A G D V X<br>    D A G F X G X V G F<br>    G A A X A X G D V G<br>    V G X G D F G D F G<br>    D V A G X V V D G X<br>    G D G F A G G F F F<br><br>As you can see, the sorting is "stable", i.e. when there are two or more characters are identical in the transposition key, they keep the original order they had. So in this example, there are three R's and two M's, and they are in the same order relative to each other both before and after the transposition. <br><br>Now, finally, we simply read off the table *column by column* to get our ciphertext. This is the final result: <br>    <br>    GADGVDGVFAAGVDAVGAXAGDGFXGGFDDXADXAAAGXFVGXGXGGVGFDVDDDFVVGVFGFAXFGGXF<br>    <br>To decrypt, reverse the operations described here.<br><br>EDIT: so, I just realized that I misspelled "Break out of jail" as "Brake out of jail", but it would be too much work to fix it now :) I apologize for the silly mistake. Then again, hardened criminals aren't known for being great spellers!<br><br><br>
<a href="http://redd.it/vmbq0">[6/26/2012] Challenge #69 [difficult]</a><br>The ADFGVX cipher described in [today's intermediate problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/vmbnb/6262012_challenge_69_intermediate/) turned out to be quite a challenge for the Allied powers, but it was finally cracked by the French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin. It is said that the work was so difficult and involved such complex techniques that it made him physically break down from the fatigue. His method required lots of similar messages encrypted during periods of high traffic. <br><br>Today we have an advantage that Painvin didn't have: massive computational power at our fingertips. Your difficult task for the day is to try and crack a message that have been encrypted using the ADFGVX cipher as defined in today's intermediate problem, without knowing either of the keys. To make the task a little bit easier, I'll give you a few hints regarding the message and how it's been encrypted:<br><br>1. The cleartext is in English<br>2. The substitution key is not any random permutation of the alphabet, it is simply a [caesar shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_shift) of the alphabet.

Good luck!<br><br>***<br><br>In 1987, mathematician John Conway invented one of the most curious programming languages ever, which he dubbed [FRACTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractran). <br><br>A FRACTRAN program is simply a series of fractions, nothing more, nothing less. As input, the program takes a single integer. The program runs like this:<br><br>1. The integer is checked against each fraction in order. If the result of multiplying that integer with the fraction is another integer, you start over with the product generated by multiplying with that fraction.<br><br>2. If none of the fractions multiplied by the input integer results in another integer, the program finishes and returns the integer as the result. <br><br>Conway was able to show that despite the simplicity of this "programming language", it is in fact Turing-complete, meaning that any computation you can do in any other language, you can do in FRACTRAN. <br><br>The [wikipedia article for FRACTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractran) explains very well how this works and how to write a program in FRACTRAN. <br><br>Your task is to first of all write a FRACTRAN interpreter that is able to run FRACTRAN programs (and remember that the numbers can very easily get very large, so 64-bit integers is not going to be enough, you need big numbers) and then to write a program in FRACTRAN. Here are a few suggestions of programs you could write, roughly ordered from least difficult to most difficult:<br><br>1. Implement the min(a,b) function. So for input 2^a * 3^b the code returns 5^min(a,b) where min(a,b) is the smallest number of a and b. Example: input 5832 should output 125 ( 2^3 \* 3^6 -&gt; 5^3 )<br><br>2. Implement the max(a,b) function. So for input 2^a * 3^b the code returns 5^max(a,b) where max(a,b) is the largest number of a and b. Example: input 5832 should output 15625 ( 2^3 \* 3^6 -&gt; 5^6 )<br><br>3. Write a program that takes an input a that is divisible by 3 and divides it by 3. So for input 2^a it returns 3^a/3 . Example: input 2097152 should output  2187 ( 2^21 -&gt; 3^7 ). Note: this can be done in a single fraction.<br><br>4. Write a program that for an input n, returns the sum of all integers less than n. So if the input is 2^5, it should output 3^1+2+3+4 = 3^10. Example: input 32 should output 59049 ( 2^5 -&gt; 3^10 )<br><br>5. Write a program that generates the nth fibonacci number. So for input 2^n it should output 3^f(n) where f(n) is the nth fibonacci number. Example: input 128 should output 1594323 ( 2^7 -&gt; 3^13 ).<br><br><br><br>

<a href="http://redd.it/w4l6e">[7/6/2012] Challenge #73 [easy]</a><br>During the 70s and 80s, some handheld calculators used a very different notation for arithmetic called [Reverse Polish notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN). Instead of putting operators (`+`, `*`, `-`, etc.) between their operands (as in `3 + 4`), they were placed behind them: to calculate `3 + 4`, you first inputted the operands (`3 4`) and then added them together by pressing `+`.<br><br>Internally, this was implemented using a stack: whenever you enter a number, it's pushed onto the stack, and whenever you enter an operator, the **top two elements** are popped off for the calculation. Here's an example of a RPN calculator calculating `3 4 * 6 2 - +`:<br><br>    [3] --&gt; 3<br>    [4] --&gt; 3 4<br>    [*] --&gt; 12      ( 3 * 4 = 12)<br>    [6] --&gt; 12 6<br>    [2] --&gt; 12 6 2<br>    [-] --&gt; 12 4    ( 6 - 2 =  4)<br>    [+] --&gt; 16      (12 + 4 = 16)<br><br>Your task is to implement a program that reads a string in Reverse Polish notation and prints the result of the calculation. Your program should support positive and negative integers and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`. (For extra credit, you can implement extra functions, such as decimal numbers, division, exponentiation, etc.)<br><br><br>

To that end, we're gonna compress it.<br><br>The idea of the Huffman encoding is to replace each character by a bit sequence whose length depends on the frequency of occurrence of the character in the string: if a character occurs very often, we want to represent it by a very short bit sequence to avoid wasting space, but if appears only once or twice, it doesn't really matter if the bit sequence is long.<br><br>**Exercise:**<br><br>1.

<a href="http://redd.it/wa0mc">[7/9/2012] Challenge #74 [easy]<br></a><br>The Fibonacci numbers, which we are all familiar with, start like this:<br><br>	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...<br>	<br>Where each new number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two.<br><br>It turns out that by summing different Fibonacci numbers with each other, you can create every single positive integer. In fact, a much stronger statement holds: <br><br>Every single positive integer can be represented in one *and only one* way as a sum of *non-consecutive* Fibonacci numbers. This is called the number's ["Zeckendorf representation"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem).<br><br>For instance, the Zeckendorf representation of the number 100 is 89 + 8 + 3, and the Zeckendorf representation of 1234 is 987 + 233 + 13 + 1. Note that all these numbers are Fibonacci numbers, and that they are non-consecutive (i.e. no two numbers in a Zeckendorf representation can be next to each other in the Fibonacci sequence).<br><br>There are other ways of summing Fibonacci numbers to get these numbers. For instance, 100 is also equal to 89 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1, but 1, 2, 3, 5 are all consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

<a href="http://redd.it/wa10w">[7/9/2012] Challenge #74 [intermediate]</a><br>In [his paper describing the so-called "Dancing Links" algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047) for solving exact cover problems (press the PDF link to see the full paper), Donald Knuth describes a rather fascinating data-structure, basically a [sparse binary matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) implemented using [doubly linked lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly.2C_doubly.2C_and_multiply_linked_lists). The linked lists are two-dimensional, so instead of just having "left" and "right" links, it has "up" and "down" links as well). <br><br>In other words, if you are given a matrix of ones and zeroes, like this:<br>    <br>    0 0 1 0 1 1 0<br>    1 0 0 1 0 0 1<br>    0 1 1 0 0 1 0<br>    1 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>    0 1 0 0 0 0 1<br>    0 0 0 1 1 0 1<br>    <br>You create a data-structure that looks something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/RXAvI.png). <br><br>The link that's marked "h" is the head link, indicating the "head" of the data-structure. The links to the right of the head link are the column headers, indicating the columns. The number that's in the column header indicates how many ones there are in that column (and thus how many links there are in that particular column). Storing those numbers is entirely optional.<br><br>The rest of the structure is created from the 0s and 1s of the matrix. If there's a 1 in the input matrix, there's a link in the data structure, if there's a 0 in the input matrix, then there's no link. <br><br>As an example, you'll notice in the input matrix that there are 1s in the third, fifth and sixth columns, so in the finished data structure, there are links in the third, fifth and sixth columns. Each link in the matrix has left and right links (to the previous and next items in the same row) and up and down links (to the previous and next items in the same column). If there are no links in the left/right/up/down, the link "wraps around" to the other side of the row or column.<br><br>While this data-structure might look huge and daunting at first glance, it turns out that it is actually quite nimble. Once constructed, rows and columns can be removed and put back with surprising ease and elegance. Indeed, when you visualize that happening in your head, it really seems as if the links are dancing.<br><br>Your task today is this: given a matrix of ones and zeroes, construct this complicated linked list data-structure. You may assume that no row or column in the original input matrix of 1s and 0s consist entirely of 0s: there's always going to be at least one 1 in every row or column.<br><br>As a bonus, you may also implement any number of the following functions that operate on the data structure:<br><br>* remove_column(X): If X is a link in the matrix data-structure, completely remove X's column from the matrix, while still maintaining the correct structure (i.e. fix all the links so they're pointing where they should point when the column is removed). Note that X can be any link in a column or a column header.<br><br>* remove_row(X): Same thing as the previous function, only this time it removes the row instead of the column<br><br>* restore_column(X): If X is a link in a column that was previously removed using remove_column(X), this function restores the column to the matrix. That is, if X is a link in the matrix, first calling "remove_column(X)" and then "restore_column(X)" should leave the matrix as it was originally.<br><br>* restore_row(X): Same thing as the previous function, only this time it restores a row that had previously been removed using remove_row(X).<br><br>For the last two functions, you may want to check Knuth's paper for a neat trick that restores previously deleted items in linked lists. <br><br>EDIT: For the remove/restore functions, you can assume that if you've removed some number of rows/columns by calling remove_row/remove_column, that the calls to restore_row/restore_column will be called *in the reverse order*. I.e. if you first removed column 1, then column 2, then column 3, you would first restore column 3, then column 2, then column 1.<br><br>Also, just to be clear: if you can't get your head around the remove/restore functions, remember that they are just a bonus and totally optional. Constructing the data-structure is the main point of this excercise. <br><br><br>

Don't worry, that doesn't mean that you have to solve the challenge in C.<br><br>In C, that the compiler is usually invoked on each of the source files in a project to produce an object file for each source file.<br>Then, these object files are linked together to produce a binary or a dynamic or static library.  Usually, something like a Makefile or an IDE does this job.  By specifying<br>the source code and project settings in some kind of configuration file, the user tells the build system tools how to make the final executable from code.<br><br>Your job is to implement your own build system that will read a project description file and then build a project.  Use the simple build-system description language I've come up with below, and extend it as you see fit!  Here's how it works:<br><br>Each line of the input file is treated as a seperate command, where each command modifies or changes the build system in some way.  Trailing or leading whitespace or blank lines do not matter.  Commands are as follows:<br><br>Commands to set the target:<br><br>    exe &lt;file&gt;<br>    lib &lt;file&gt;<br>    <br>This says that the current build target is an executable named &lt;file&gt;, or a static lib named &lt;file&gt;.

For some examples, look [here](http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/cpp/cpp.html#SEC2) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)<br><br>Your task is to implement as much of the C preprocessor as you can in as few lines as you can.

I find it much more enjoyable to write computer programs to solve these problems for me. In the spirit of that, today's problem is to find simple one-word anagrams for other words.<br><br>Write a program that given a word will find all one-word anagrams for that word. So, for instance, if you put in "LEPROUS", it should return "PELORUS" and "SPORULE". As a dictionary, use [this file](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt), which is a 1.8 mb text-file with one word listed on each line, each word listed in lower-case. In this problem description, I've used upper-case for all words and their anagrams, but that is entirely optional, it's perfectly all right to use lower-case if you want to. <br><br>Using your program, find all the one-word anagrams for "TRIANGLE".<br><br>***<br><br>*(by the way, in case anyone is curious: a "PELORUS" is "a sighting device on a ship for taking the relative bearings of a distant object", which I imagine basically is a telescope bolted onto a compass, and a "SPORULE" is "a small spore")*<br><br>***<br><br>Bonus: if you looked up the anagrams for "PAGERS", you'd find that there was actually quite a few of them: "GAPERS", "GASPER", "GRAPES", "PARGES" and "SPARGE". Those five words plus "PAGERS" make a six-word "anagram family". <br><br>Here's another example of an anagram family, this time with five words: "AMBLERS", "BLAMERS", "LAMBERS", "MARBLES" and "RAMBLES".<br><br>What is the largest anagram family in the dictionary I supplied?

<a href="http://redd.it/x0vcj">[7/23/2012] Challenge #80 [intermediate] (Poker hands)</a><br>Your intermediate task today is to write a program that can identify a hand in poker. <br><br>Let each hand be represented as a string composed of five different cards. Each card is represented by two characters, "XY", where X is the rank of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q or K) and Y is the suit of the card (H, D, C or S). <br><br>So, for instance, "AH" would be the Ace of Hearts, "2C" would be the 2 of Clubs, "JD" would be the Jack of Diamonds, "TS" would be the Ten of Spades, and so on. Then a hand with a full house could be represented as "2C 2H TS TH TC" (a pair of twos and three tens).<br><br>Write a program that takes a string like this and prints out what type of hand it is. So, for instance, given "2C 2H TS TH TC" it would print out "Full house". Note that the cards will not necessarily be in any kind of particular order, "2C 2H TS TH TC" is the same hand as "TC 2C 2H TS TH". <br><br>For reference, here are the different possible hands in poker, from most valuable to least valuable. Your program should be able to recognize all of these:<br><br>* Royal flush: a hand with a Ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace in the same suit<br>* Straight flush: a hand with five cards of consecutive rank in the same suit<br>* Four of a kind: a hand with four cards of the same rank<br>* Full house: a hand with a pair and a three of a kind<br>* Flush: a hand with all cards the same suit<br>* Straight: a hand with five cards of consecutive rank<br>* Three of a kind: a hand with three cards of the same rank<br>* Two pair: a hand with two pairs<br>* Pair: and hand with two cards of the same rank<br>* High card: a hand with nothing special in it<br><br>Obviously, any one hand can qualify for more than one of these; every royal flush is obviously also a straight flush, and every straight flush is obviously also a flush. But you should only print out the kind with the most value, so "2H 3H 4H 5H 6H" should print out "Straight flush", not "Flush". <br><br>***<br><br>Bonus: write a function that given two different poker hands tells you which hand is the winner. When there are apparent ties, standard poker rules apply: if both players have a pair, the player with the highest pair wins. If both have pairs of the same rank, the player with the highest card not in the pair wins (or second highest, or third highest, if there are more ties). Note that poker hands can be absolute ties: for instance, if two players both have flushes in different colors but with identical ranks, that's an absolute tie, and your function should return with that result. <br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://redd.it/x0vj7">[7/23/2012] Challenge #80 [difficult] (Multi-word anagrams)</a><br>In [today's easy problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/x0v3e/7232012_challenge_80_easy_anagrams/), we investigated anagrams that were single words. However, as is clear in the "I am Lord Voldemort" and "Tom Marvolo Riddle" example, anagrams can also be several words long. <br><br>Your difficult task today is to write a program that given a word will generate all multi-word anagrams of that word. Use [the same dictionary as in the easy problem](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt). <br><br>So, for instance, the word "PARLIAMENT" has (by my count) ~~6636~~ 8438 multi-word anagrams using that dictionary. Examples include "MENIAL PRAT", "INEPT ALARM", "EAT NIL PRAM" (most of them will not make any sense) and "PARLIAMENT" itself. Note that in this problem, if the difference between two permutation is only word order, they count as the same anagram. So "INEPT ALARM" and "ALARM INEPT" should just count as one anagram. <br><br>Also, if there are single-word anagrams of the input, they should be counted in the total. For instance, in the 63 (again, by my count) multi-word anagrams of "MARBLES", the words "AMBLERS", "BLAMERS", "LAMBERS" and "RAMBLES" are included, as well as "MARBLES" itself (a few examples of multi-word anagrams for "MARBLES" are "ARM BELS", "REM LABS" and "ELM BARS").<br><br>How many multi-word anagrams is there for "CARPENTER" and "INHERITANCE"?<br><br>EDIT: Thanks to Cosmologicon for corrections!<br><br><br>

<a href="http://redd.it/xdwyb">[7/30/2012] Challenge #83 [easy] (Long scale and short scale)</a><br>One of the most annoying and confusing differences between English and basically every other language in the world is that English uses a weird way to name very large numbers. <br><br>For instance, if you wanted to translate "one trillion" from English to French, you might think it would be "un trillion", but that is wrong. The correct translation of "one trillion" to French is "un billion". Well, then, you might ask, what is "one billion" in French? It is, in fact, "un milliard". And "un trillion" in French is equal to english "one quintillion". Confusing, no?<br><br>The reason for this is that there are two so-called scales for large numbers, [the long scale and the short scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales). English uses the short scale, almost everyone else uses the long scale (though the Arabic languages also apparently use the short scale). The two systems can be summarized as follows:<br><br>* In the *short scale*, you get a "new word" for the numbers every time the number increases by a factor of 1,000. So "a thousand millions" is "one billion" and "a thousand billions" is "one trillion".<br><br>* In the *long scale*, you get a "new word" for the numbers every time the number increases by a factor of 1,000,000. So "a million millions" is the same as "one billion" and "a million billions" is the same as "one trillion".

Even as simple a task as printing out a string requires quite lengthy code. Today, we will simplify that task quite a bit!<br><br>Your task today is to write a program that takes a string as input and outputs Brainfuck code that, when run, will print out that string.

What makes it so lovely? Well, first off all, it's in the [SVG format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map.svg), which means that you can download it and edit it quite easily, even with a computer program you write yourself (SVG is nothing but XML, after all).<br><br>Second, the kind mapmaker has gone to the extra trouble of labelling all the states in the code with their proper abbreviation (so "AR" for "Arkansas" and "MT" for "Montana"). For instance, look at the source file for that image, and you'll see that the first path that is defined has the id "HI", so we know it represents Hawaii. <br><br>By parsing that file, noting the "id" attributes of the various "path" tags, you can then change the color of a specific state by changing the "style" attribute. For instance, if we change Hawaii's style attribute from<br><br>    fill:#d3d3d3;stroke:#ffffff;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-width:0.75;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none<br>    <br>to<br><br>    fill:#ff0000;stroke:#ffffff;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-width:0.75;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none<br>    <br>then Hawaii will stand out as bright red. <br><br>Your task today is to write a program that will read in that SVG file, then assign colors to all the different US states, such that no states that share a border has the same color.  [Here is an example](http://i.imgur.com/QN3sG.png). You don't have to figure out what states border which other states from the SVG file, you can just put that as a table in your code, or use any other solution you can come up with. <br><br>If you finish, please upload your image, or a PNG of your image, to imgur, so the rest of us can see what it looks like!<br><br>Bonus: By the [4-color theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-color_theorem) all maps like this can be colored using at most 4 colors, so that no two regions that share a border have the same color. Color the map using only four different colors.<br><br>**NOTE:** Look out for Michigan! Michigan is tricky. <br><br>***<br><br>Edit: to make it easier for everyone, [here's a list of what states borders other states](http://pastebin.com/uNJAEfgr). I compiled it myself, so I can't guarantee accuracy (though I'm fairly sure it's accurate, and it works fine in my program).

For example, lets say we wanted to describe force.  Force is defined as mass * acceleration.<br>accelleration is defined as velocity per second.  velocity is defined as length per second.   Therefore, force is mass*length per second per second, so force is defined as <br>m kg s^-1 s^-1 in SI units.<br><br>Write a program that can read in a units expression involving multiplying and dividing units and output the correct expression of those units in SI base units.  Furthermore, you should make it so that your program ALSO accepts SI derived units as well, such as "watts" or "pascals" (there is a list of SI derived units and their base definitions [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_units)).  If you can, you should also include some simple aliases that aren't even base units, such as 'mass' is 'kg' and 'velocity' is m/s.<br><br>Examples (input,output):<br><br>    m/s*m*cd -&gt; s^-1 m^2 cd<br>    newton/m -&gt; s^-2 kg<br>    watt/velocity -&gt; s^-2 m kg<br>    <br>BONUS:  Make it so, when printing, if there is a simpler name for the quanity output than the base name, then it also prints that as well.

I.e. more e's and t's than x's and z's. Also, modify your code so that it will insert commas, exclamation points, question marks and the occassional number (as a separate word, obviously). <br><br>***<br><br>* Thanks to [Racoonie](http://www.reddit.com/user/Racoonie) for suggesting this problem at /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas! <br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://redd.it/zaa0v">[9/03/2012] Challenge #95 [difficult] (Overlapping rectangles)</a><br>Let the four values (x, y, w, h) define a rectangle. Let the bottom left corner be located at (x, y) and let (w, h) be the width and height. Then the rectangles (0,0,4,3), (4,3,3,4) and (7,0,3,3) would look something like this:<br><br>            * * * <br>            * * * <br>            * * *<br>            * * *<br>    * * * *       * * *<br>    * * * *       * * *<br>    * * * *       * * *<br><br>The total area of these three rectangles is simple to compute, it's just the sum of the areas of each individual rectangle: 4\*3 + 3\*4 + 3\*3 = 12 + 12 + 9 = 33.<br><br>It gets more tricky when the rectangles start overlapping each other. For instance, lets look at the three rectangles (0,0,4,3), (2,1,3,4) and (4,4,3,3):<br><br>            * * * <br>            * * * <br>        * * + * * <br>        * * *     <br>    * * + + *      <br>    * * + + *      <br>    * * * *       <br><br>You see that the rectangles overlap (the regions where they overlap is marked by a + instead of a \*). So if we just calculate the sum of the areas like we did before, 12 + 12 + 9, we get too high a value, because we're counting the areas with the overlap twice. To get the correct answer, we have to subtract the areas where two rectangles intersect. The righ answer for the total area covered by the rectangles is then (12 + 12 + 9) - (4 + 1) = 28. <br><br>Things get even more hairy when three rectangles intersect. Take a look at (0,0,4,3), (2,1,3,4) and (3,0,3,3):<br><br>        * * *<br>        * * *     <br>    * * + x + *      <br>    * * + x + *   <br>    * * * + * *   <br>          <br>Now the three rectangles all overlap at the points marked x (as before, the +'s mark where only two rectangles overlap). We do as before and start by calculating the sum of the areas of all three triangles: 12 + 12 + 9. Then we subtract the sum of all areas where two rectangles intersect, which is now 4 + 3 + 4. This is because rectangle 1 and 2 intersect in a region with the area 4, rectangles 1 and 3 intersect in an region with an area of 3 (this is th 1\*3 "column" that includes the x's and the + right below them), and rectangles 2 and 3 intersect in a region with the area of 4. So far we've got (12 + 12 + 9) - (4 + 3 + 4). <br><br>However, by subtracting out all regions where two rectangles intersect, we've subtracted out the region where three rectangles intersect (i.e. the x's) three times. That is to say, we're not counting it at all. So we have to add that back in to get the right result. So the total area covered by the rectangles is, in fact, <br><br>    A = (12 + 12 + 9) - (4 + 3 + 4) + (2) = 33 - 11 + 2 = 24<br><br>If you wish to verify that number, you can count the *'s, +'s and x's and you'll see that they add up to 24. <br><br>This sounds complicated, but the general rule is actually quite simple and elegant. If S1 is the sum of the areas of all rectangles, S2 is the sum of all regions where *two* rectangles intersect, S3 is the sum of all regions where *three* rectangles intersect, S4 is the sum of all regions where *four* rectangles intersect, and so on, the value of the total area covered is:<br><br>    A = S1 - S2 + S3 - S4 + S5 - S6 + S7 - S8 + ...<br><br>This is known in mathematics as the [inclusion-exclusion principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_exclusion_principle), because you alternate including and excluding areas. <br><br>The values in my example correspond to:<br><br>    S1 = 12 + 12 + 9 <br>    S2 = 4 + 3 + 4  <br>    S3 = 2<br>    S4 = 0<br>    S5 = 0<br>    S6 = 0<br>    ...<br>    <br>With all variables above S3 equal to zero, so we don't need to count them.<br><br>Define a random number generator as follows: <br><br>    s(0) = 123456789<br>    s(N) = (22695477 * s(N-1) + 12345) mod 1073741824<br>    <br>Then define a function r(N) which returns rectangles (in the (x,y,w,h) for described here) like this:<br><br>    r(N) = (s(4*N) mod 2000000, s(4*N + 1) mod 2000000, 1 + (s(4*N + 2) mod 99999), 1 + (s(4*N + 3) mod 99999))<br>    <br>That is, <br><br>    r(0) = (s(0) mod 2000000, s(1) mod 2000000, 1 + (s(2) mod 99999), 1 + (s(3) mod 99999)) <br>    r(1) = (s(4) mod 2000000, s(5) mod 2000000, 1 + (s(6) mod 99999), 1 + (s(7) mod 99999)) <br><br>In actual numbers, r(0) and r(1) is:<br><br>    r(0) = (1456789, 880530, 94008, 74226)<br>    r(1) = (1429729, 1957326, 87910, 3758)<br><br>Generate 2000 of these rectangles (i.e. r(0) through r(1999)) and calculate the total area they cover. <br><br>***<br><br>Bonus: Define r(N) like this instead:<br><br>    r(N) = (s(4*N) mod 10000000, s(4*N + 1) mod 10000000, 1 + (s(4*N + 2) mod 99999), 1 + (s(4*N + 3) mod 99999))<br><br>The only thing that has changed is the modulus on the (x,y) values.

Unfortunately, it only has 2 controller ports, and you have N friends who all want to play at the same time.<br><br>Fortunately, however, the ps2 has an accessory called a 'multitap' that multiplexes one controller port into four controller ports, to allow more than 2 controllers at once.  <br><br>Pretend you don't know that only one multitap can be used in a given PS2 at once. By connecting multitaps to multitaps, you could easily create a complicated tree architecture to get as many ports as you need.  However, you also have limited resources at your disposal. <br><br>Given that a controller costs $20, and a multitap costs $12, write a function that takes in an integer D for the amount of money you have (in dollars) and returns the total maximum number of people you could afford to get to play with you on one ps2 tree.<br><br>For example, the ps2 has 2 ports to start with and comes with 1 controller, so if D &lt; 20, then the function should return 1.<br>However, when you add another $20, you can afford another controller, so for D = 20, the function should return 2.<br>Adding another controller costs you not only another $20 for the controller, but also $12 for the first multitap to go into the system, so for 20&lt;=D&lt;(40+12), you should return N=3.<br><br>This is tricky because once you get &gt;5 controllers, you need ANOTHER multitap...and greater than 8 controllers you need 3+ multitaps.<br><br><br><br>

The advantage of this map is that it is very easy to assign different colors to each state (for details on how to do this, [see the previous problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/yj38u/8202012_challenge_89_difficult_coloring_the/)). We only had some silly fun with it, but it can also obviously be very useful in visualizing information about the country. <br><br>[Here is a text-file with unemployment data](https://gist.github.com/3740029) for all US states for each month from January 1980 to June 2012, stored in [CSV format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). The first column is the dates, then each column is the data for each state (the order of which is detailed in the headers). I got this information from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis [FRED database](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/), which has excellent API access (good work, St. Louis Fed!). <br><br>Using this table, make a program that can draw a map of unemployment across the United States at a given date. For instance, [here is a map of unemployment for July 2005](http://i.imgur.com/O4LP2.png). As you can see, I edited the map slightly, adding a scale to the left side and a header that includes the date. You can do that too if you wish, but it is not necessary in any way. <br><br>Your map doesn't need to look anything like mine. You can experiment with different colors and different styles. I selected the colors linearly based on unemployment, but you may want to use a different function to select colors, or perhaps color all states within a certain range the same (so that all states with 0%-2% are the same color, as are the states with 2%-4%, 4%-6%, etc).

<a href="http://redd.it/13hmzb">[11/20/2012] Challenge #113 [Difficult] Memory Allocation Insanity!</a><br>**Description:**<br><br>Cyberdyne Systems Corporation is working on a powerful new processors, but due to a management snafu, the management has only allowed your code 512 Kilobytes (524288 Bytes) to implement your application's heap! For those unfamiliar with the [heap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation#Dynamic_memory_allocation), it is an area of memory for processes where (the process) can allocate variable memory sizes on at run-time.<br><br>The problem here is that you can't use any pre-built code or libraries to serve your memory allocation needs in this tiny space, so you are now going to have to re-implement your own [malloc and free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation) functions!<br><br>Your goal is to implement two functions, regardless of language, named "malloc" and "free". Malloc takes a number of bytes (up to a maximum of 128 Kb at a time) and returns either a new address (array) that your process can use, or returns an invalid point (empty array) if there is not enough free space. This array must be continuous (i.e. a continuous block of 128 Kb). Free simply takes the given array and allows it to be reused by future malloc function calls.<br><br>Your code must only work in 512Kb, meaning that both the allocate memory AND the related data structures must reside in this 512Kb space. Your code is not part of this measurement. As an example, if you use a linked-list that requires one byte over-head for each allocated chunk, that means you must be able to contain this linked-list structure and the allocated spaces.<br><br>There are many methods to implement a heap structure; investigate either the Linux Slab allocator, or try to stick to the obvious solutions of linked lists. Don't forget to coalesce freed spaces over time! An example of this situations is when you have three blocks, left, middle, and right, where the left and right are unallocated, but the middle is allocated. Upon free-ing the middle block, your code should understand that there aren't three free blocks left, but instead one large unified block!<br><br>**Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs:**<br><br>*Input Description:*<br><br>* `void* malloc(size_t ByteCount);` // Returns a pointer to available memory that is the "ByteCount" size in bytes<br>* `void free(void* Ptr);` // Frees a given block of memory on this heap<br><br>*Output Description:*<br><br>No formal output is required, but a helpful tool for you to develop is printing the memory map of the heap, useful for debugging.<br><br>**Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs:**<br><br>* `void* PtrA = Malloc(131072);` // Allocating 128Kb; success<br>* `void* PtrB = Malloc(131072);` // Allocating 128Kb; success<br>* `void* PtrC = Malloc(131072);` // Allocating 128Kb; success<br>* `void* PtrD = Malloc(131072);` // Allocating 128Kb; fails, unlikely to return 128Kb since any implementation will require memory over-head, thus you will have less than 128Kb left on the heap before calling this function<br>* `free(PtrC);` // Free 128Kb; success<br>* `void* PtrD = Malloc(131072);` // Allocating 128Kb; success<br><br>**Note**<br><br>It is likely that you will have to implement this simulation / code in C or C++, simply because many high-level languages such as Java or Ruby will hide the necessary low-level memory controls required. You can still use these high-level languages, but you must be very strict about following the memory limitation rule.<br><br><br>

It is named "Pack-o-Tron 5000": an automated box-packing solution. Moving to a new home? Traveling overseas? Going on a business trip? No matter what, this device will help you pack your boxes optimally, reducing empty space and fitting more objects in less area!<br><br>As the lead engineer, you are tasked with designing the code that generates the "optimal placement" of items in a given area. Fortunately for you, the "Pack-o-Tron 5000" only works with very specific definitions of "items" and "areas". (Shh, don't tell the customers that, marketing is still working on it).<br><br>An "area" is an empty 2D grid, where the length and width are integers representing inches. As an example, a suitcase could be defined as a 36-inch by 48-inch grid. An "item" is a 2D object, whose length and width are integers representing inches. As an example, a tooth-brush item can be 1-inch in width, and 3-inches long.<br><br>Your goal is to place all given items in a given area as optimally as possible. "Optimally" is defined as having the smallest minimum-rectangle that spans your set of items.<br><br>Note that the "area" is defined as a grid where the origin is in the top-left and X+ grows to the right, with Y+ growing to the bottom. An item's origin is in the top-left, with X+ growing to the right, and Y+ growing to the bottom. A minimum-rectangle that spans your set of items is a rectangle on the grid that includes all items placed, and is either equal to or smaller than the given area. Your goal is to make this minimum-span as small as possible. You are allowed to place your objects in any position, as long as it is in the grid. You are also allowed to rotate your objects by 90 degrees.<br><br>[Here is an album of several examples of how objects are placed, and how they can be moved and rotated to minimized the minimum-span rectangle.](http://imgur.com/a/M3MNk)<br><br>**Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs:**<br><br>*Input Description:*<br><br>You will first be given two integers: the width and height of your starting (empty) grid.

All of this is done through standard input. (i.e. console).<br><br>*Output Description:*<br><br>Once you have optimally placed the given items in the given grid such that it as the smallest minimum-span possible, you must print each item's x and y coordinate (as an integer), and the object's size (to show us if there has been any rotations).<br><br>**Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs:**<br><br>[Take a look at the example images here.](http://imgur.com/a/M3MNk) For all images that have the two 1x3 items, you would be given the following sample input:<br><br>    8 8<br>    2<br>    1 3<br>    1 3<br><br>The most optimal result (the last image) is a 2x3 minimum-span, which can be described in the following:<br><br>    0 0 1 3<br>    1 0 1 3<br><br>For those who are keen observers, an equivalent solution is the same pair of objects, but mirrored on the diagonal axis:<br><br>    0 0 3 1<br>    0 1 3 1<br><br>*Note:*<br><br>This is essentially a clean version of the [Packing Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_problem).
